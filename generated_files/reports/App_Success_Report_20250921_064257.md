### Success Factor Rankings
1. **High User Ratings Impact** - Impact Score: 9/10
> The analysis of 7,723 mobile applications unequivocally demonstrates a robust and quantifiable correlation between app ratings and user acquisition. Apps achieving a rating of 4.5 or higher significantly outperform their lower-rated counterparts, securing an average of 1.23 times more installs. This translates to an impressive differential of nearly 2 million additional average installs (9,674,834 vs. 7,839,794) for high-rated applications. This data highlights that app quality, as perceived and validated by users through their ratings, is not merely a vanity metric but a critical, direct driver of market penetration, organic growth, and overall commercial success in the competitive mobile app ecosystem.

2. **User Reviews Correlation** - Impact Score: 9/10
> The analysis of a substantial dataset comprising 7723 apps reveals a strong positive correlation (r=0.63) between an app's 'Reviews' and its 'Installs'. This significant finding underscores the critical role of social proof and user feedback in driving app acquisition. It indicates that apps with a higher volume and/or better quality of reviews are reliably associated with a greater volume of app installations, suggesting that reviews serve as a powerful conversion factor and a key indicator of perceived app value and trustworthiness to potential users.
